# WOLTY

Hello ladies and gents!

Are you also ordering wolt? [Yes] üõµüí®

Are you also struggeling to decide WTF? [Yes] üôãüèªü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Are you also around 30, paying taxes and not sure where life is heading? [YES!] üò≠

GOOD!üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I can't solve that, but I can maybe help you order food.

### TL;DR ‚ÑπÔ∏è
It can randomize a selection for you so you can leave the brain melted on the floor and keep crying in the corner. Yay! #goals

### Usage üê≥

Assuming you have docker running [if not - cmd+w away], do the following:

```sh
$ docker run aviadhahami/wolty "MY_LOCATION"
```

### Le Grand Feature üë®üèª
```sh
$ docker run aviadhahami/wolty "MY_LOCATION" --random
```
Will randomly select a venue. Hungry but it yielded a shakes bar? eat shit Leeroy. _Or just re-run. doh._

### Wanna eat the wolrd but not sure in which order? use `sort`!
> A quick reminder that bucket sort is not really a sort
```sh
$ docker run aviadhahami/wolty "MY_LOCATION_AGAIN" --sort=[rating | price | deliveryTime | deliveryPrice]
```

### WAIT WHAT AND WHERE IS MOMMY
Still struggeling? me too.
See help menu by running:
```sh
$ docker run aviadhahami/wolty -h 
```


### Wanna help?
Guess you're bored too. PR at will ‚ù§Ô∏è
